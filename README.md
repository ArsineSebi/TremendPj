 <h1 align="center">Tremend Project</h1>

# Description
 In this project I created a github workflow which triggers the build and run of a docker image . Also I published the image on DockerHub
 
 # Steps
 1. Clone the repo 
 
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/ArsineSebi/TremendPj.git
 cd TremendPj
 ```
 
 2. Make a change and commit
 ```bash
 vi file
 git add file
 git commit -m "message"
 git push
  ```
 3. See results in github workflows:
 https://github.com/ArsineSebi/TremendPj/actions
 
 4. See the image uploaded on dockerhub:
 https://hub.docker.com/u/sebilocomotion
 
 5. If you want to configure for your own project you can update the environment secrets.
